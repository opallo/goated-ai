# AIOS - LLM Agent Operating System

## Introduction
AIOS (LLM Agent Operating System) is an ambitious project aimed at embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) into the core of operating systems, inspired by the pioneering research outlined in the AIOS paper. By integrating LLMs as the brain of the operating system, AIOS envisions creating an operating system "with soul"â€”a significant leap towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This project focuses on optimizing resource allocation, facilitating context switching across agents, enabling concurrent execution of agents, providing a comprehensive tool service for agents, all while maintaining strict access control.

## Project Goals
- **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Ensure efficient utilization of LLM resources to prevent bottlenecks and maximize throughput.
- **Facilitate Context Switching**: Enable seamless context switching across different agents to maintain continuity and efficiency.
- **Enable Concurrent Execution**: Allow multiple agents to execute concurrently without compromising on performance or accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Tool Service**: Develop a robust set of tools that agents can leverage to perform a wide range of tasks.
- **Maintain Access Control**: Implement stringent access control measures to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of agent operations.

## Architecture
Following the guidance from the AIOS paper, the architecture adopts a layered approach...
